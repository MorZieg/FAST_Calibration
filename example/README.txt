These files are intended for demonstration and testing of the FAST Calibration tool. The example consists of a small root and branch model. The root model has an extent of 10x10x5 km^3 and the branch model has an extent of 4x4x4 km^3. The models are presented as Abaqus solver input files (.inp) and output files (.odb). For both, root and branch, an initial stress state, a calibration model with three boundary condition scenarios, and a final model are presented. The geometry is in separate files (.geom). Furthermore, the nodes of the root model are represented in a .csv file. The exemplary parameters that are provided in the Matlab scripts match these examples.

The .odb files can be directly loaded in Tecplot 360 EX and the FAST Calibration can hence be tested without using Abaqus to solve the models. Please note that the models were solved using Abaqus 6.14. Output files from this version of Abaqus can only be read from Tecplot 360 EX 2017 onwards. For compatibility with older Tecplot 360 EX versions or in order to experience the entire workflow the input files can be rerun in Abaqus (older Tecplot 360 EX versions require Abaqus 6.11 output files). The following steps are required:

1.	Abaqus: Run root_initial.inp and root_calibration.inp.
2.	Matlab: Execute the first part of root_calibration.m. A Tecplot 360 EX macro file is written in the current Matlab directory.
3.	Tecplot 360 EX: Load root_calibration.odb, compute SHmax and Shmin with the GeoStress Addon, and execute the macro root.mcr that was generated by Matlab in 2. SHmax and Shmin at the calibration points are written to two files in the /data/ subdirectory.
4.	Matlab: Execute the second part of root_calibration.m. Matlab provides the best-fit boundary conditions for the root model.
5.	Open a text editor and set the boundary conditions in root_final.inp according to the output of Matlab in 4.
6.	Abaqus: Run root_final.inp.

Now, the root model is successfully calibrated on stress data records. For a multistage procedure continue as follows:	

7.	Abaqus: Run branch_initial.inp and branch_calibration.inp.
8.	Matlab: Execute the first part of branch_calibration.m. Two Tecplot 360 EX macros files are written in the current Matlab directory.
9.	Tecplot 360 EX: Load branch_calibration.odb, compute SHmax and Shmin with the GeoStress Addon, and execute the branch_calib.mcr macro that was generated by Matlab in 8. SHmax and Shmin at the calibration points are written to two files in the /data/ subdirectory.
10.	Tecplot 360 EX: Load root_final.odb, compute SHmax and Shmin with the GeoStress Addon, and execute the macro root_branch_calib.mcr that was generated by Matlab in 8. SHmax and Shmin at the calibration points are written to two files in the /data/ subdirectory.
11.	Matlab: Execute the second part of branch_calibration.m. Matlab provides the best-fit boundary conditions for the branch model.
12.	Open a text editor and set the boundary conditions in branch_final.inp according to the output of Matlab in 10.
13.	Abaqus: Run branch_final.inp.
